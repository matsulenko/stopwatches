Stopwatches is a SwiftUI app for iOS and iPadOS. You can set up to 10 independent stopwatches. Special "Start all" or "Stop all" buttons can help you to start or stop all your stopwatches.

# Features
## Thousandths of a second accuracy
Stopwatches work with thousandths of a second accuracy. The final result of a stopwatch run is the difference between times of tapping stop and start buttons.
An active stopwatch display is updated on the screen by a timer every 0.021 seconds after start.

## Up to ten independent stopwatches at the same time
